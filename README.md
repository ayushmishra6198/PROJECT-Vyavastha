Project Management System
Academic Project management is a major issue which is faced by many educational institutes, 
the main reason for this is there is no automated system followed in any institute. 
College management/staff gathers all the project reports and project sources from students and store them physically in some locations probably libraries. 
To overcome this practical problem and also to make the process easy we developed a secured intranet application which is useful for each.


Before starting the server install mongodb on your system.

To start the server following command will be used
//nodemon app.js


For the Incharge section Type
//localhost:3000/incharge
